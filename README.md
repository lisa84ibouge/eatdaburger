# eatdaburger
Restaurant app for ordering burgers

This application is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This application follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

The logger site is deployed using Heroku. 

To use this application, first go to the webpage. Then type in the name of the app you would like to order. Once the burger has been inputted and submitted it is then generated on the HTML page using JavaScript. The user then has the opportunity to "Devour It" in which case the burger is moved to a different section of the site and remains on the app with the other hamburgers that have been devoured.
